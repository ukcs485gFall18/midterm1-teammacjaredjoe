#  Picnic

Description and Functionality: A utilization of buttons and animations to make an animated bug do different things such as flash different colors and zig zag around.

Original Capabilities: The original tutorial was located on raywenderlich.com, a site that provides many iOS tutorial articles. The tutorial provided a starter application that consisted of a bug inside of a picnic basket. By the time we were finished with the application, the basket would fly open when the application loaded, and the bug would skitter back and forth inside of the basket. Then, the user would be able to kill the bug by tapping it. 

Added Capabilities: We could see from the tutorial that many different properties of objects could be animated in many different ways using UIView animations. We wanted to add functionality to the project that could further explore this.
Joe modified the code such that the basket’s lids could be opened using swipe gestures. This was done by adding up and down swipe gesture recognizers to the code. Mac’s feature further explored chaining animations together by causing the bug to zig-zag towards the button then return to its home base. Finally, Jared’s feature was a button that could cause the bug to flash different colors. This feature could be turned on or off.
